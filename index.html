			<h2>
				<span class="small-title">The Question</span>
				How can technology help patients deal with these factors, so they adhere more accurately and consistently?
			</h2>

		<section class="section__explanation">
			<p>
			Access was our primary concern. Smartphone adoption is growing but 35% of the U.S. population still doesn’t own one.<sup><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2015/03/PI_Smartphones_0401151.pdf">4</a></sup> Smartphones offer many additional features but impose a barrier of entry that seemed too high. Reliance on personal computers is also problematic, especially among disadvantaged patients. 
			</p>
			<p>
			We narrowed our exploration to technology that was pervasive and familiar. Nearly 9 out of 10 American adults use a phone capable of texting.<sup><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/09/22/442518139/text-reminders-help-people-lower-their-heart-disease-risk">5</a></sup> Furthermore, adherence studies using text reminders show promising results.<sup><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/09/22/442518139/text-reminders-help-people-lower-their-heart-disease-risk">6</a></sup>  Texting shows the potential to address difficult issues around the world and across verticals. In Libya, the development of the world’s first SMS voter registration system led to 1.5 million voter registrations.<sup><a href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/case-study/libya-SMS-text-message-voter-registration">7</a></sup>
			</p>
			<p>
			Could texts be used not only to send reminders but also to build an ongoing two-way dialogue with a trusted health partner? Would this conversation help improve medication adherence?

			<h2>
				<span class="small-title">The Concept</span>
				Meet Florence
			</h2>
			<p>
				Our explorations led to the concept of Florence — a personal companion that would help patients understand and manage their medication regimen.  A chatbot at heart, patients would converse with her through text and picture messages. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If developed, a simple, familiar interface would hide her powerful intelligence. Behind the scenes, machine learning and behavioral modeling would enable her to offer a tailored, human experience based on each patient’s needs.

			<h2>
				<span class="small-title">Behind the Scenes</span>
				While Florence is only a concept, here are some things that will be helpful in making her come alive.
			</h2>
		</header>


		<section class="section__explanation">

			<img src="assets/florence-capeless.svg" alt="" class="explanation__background">

			<section class="explanation__tag--left">
				<h3>Medical Knowledge Bases</h3>
				<img src="assets/icon-knowledge-base.png" alt="">
				<p>Side effects and drug interactions are currently available in services like <a href="http://www.epocrates.com">Epocrates</a> and <a href="http://www.medscape.com">Medscape</a>. Though designed for long-form reading, it could be pruned and adapted to fit messaging constraints. </p>
			</section>

			<section class="explanation__tag--right">
				<h3>Algorithmic Content</h3>
				<img src="assets/icon-comprehension.svg" alt="">
				<p>Generating believable messages that don’t feel artificial or templated is key to maintaining the illusion. Tools like <a href="https://automatedinsights.com/wordsmith">Automated Insights Wordsmith</a> hint to possibilities where content can be produced on the fly and personalized to each user.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="explanation__tag--left">
				<h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
				<img src="assets/icon-processing.png" alt="">
				<p>Florence’s conversational style will encourage users to speak to her like a friend. Natural language processing, like those offered by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson">IBM’s Watson</a>, will be needed to extract meaning and respond intelligently.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="explanation__tag--right">
				<h3>Behavioral Modeling</h3>
				<img src="assets/icon-denial.svg" alt="">
				<p>Florence can generate many different messages which, unchecked, could make her a little <strong>too</strong> friendly. A system that learns the preferences of users will be helpful in tailoring which kinds of messages are sent, when, and in what frequency.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="explanation__tag--left">
				<h3>IoT Integrations</h3>
				<img src="assets/icon-integration.png" alt="">
				<p>The emergence of connected adherence devices like <a href="http://www.proteus.com">Proteus</a> pills and <a href="http://smrxt.com/index.php">Smrxt</a> bottles, combined with the popularity of health devices like <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/home">Fitbits</a> and <a href="https://www.getqardio.com">Qardio</a>, can provide a more rounded view of patients. Aggregating and synthesizing that information, perhaps using services like <a href="http://validic.com">Validic</a>, would help Florence interact more appropriately.</p>

			<p>
			Our concept, Florence, attempts to address significant causes of non-adherence from a patient’s perspective, and through the use of technology. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The problem of non-adherence, however is broader than those factors. This problem needs to be approached from multiple dimensions: socio-economic, education, healthcare access, and treatment models—to name a few. Technology is just one means of attack, not the only one.  
			</p>
			<p>
			<!-- both elements will be floated left in css -->
			If you’re interested in learning more about this problem, we encourage you to read the <a href="http://www.who.int/chp/knowledge/publications/adherence_full_report.pdf">World Health Organization’s report Evidence for Action</a>. It provides a digestible overview and deep analysis into the problem.
